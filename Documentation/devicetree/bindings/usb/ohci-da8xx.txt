* OHCI controller for DaVinci DA8XX

This binding is subject to change.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "ti,ohci-da8xx"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region at index 0 and the base address of the CFGCHIP2 register at index 1.
- interrupts: The OHCI interrupt
- vbus-supply: phandle of the associated VBUS supply. This regulator is used to
               enable/disable VBUS and handle overcurrent.

Example:

	vbus_reg: vbus_reg {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name = "usb11-vbus-supply";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
		gpio = <&gpio 101 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		enable-active-high;
	};

	usb11: usb11@1e25000 {
		compatible = "ti,ohci-da8xx";
		reg = <0x225000 0x1000>, <0x14184 4>;
		reg-names = "ohci", "cfgchip2";
		interrupts = <59>;
		vbus-supply = <&vbus_reg>;
	};
