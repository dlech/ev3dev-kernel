* Device tree bindings for Texas Instruments DaVinci timer

This document provides bindings for the 64-bit timer in the DaVinci
architecture devices. The timer can be configured as a general-purpose 64-bit
timer, dual general-purpose 32-bit timers. When configured as dual 32-bit
timers, each half can operate in conjunction (chain mode) or independently
(unchained mode) of each other.

It is global timer is a free running up-counter and can generate interrupt
when the counter reaches preset counter values.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "ti,davinci-timer".
- reg : specifies base physical address and count of the registers.
- clocks : the clock feeding the timer clock.

Example:

	clocksource: timer@20000 {
		compatible = "ti,davinci-timer";
		reg = <0x20000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&pll0_auxclk>;
	};
