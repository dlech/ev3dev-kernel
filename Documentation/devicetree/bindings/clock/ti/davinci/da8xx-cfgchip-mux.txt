Binding for TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP multiplexer clocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a general purpose set of
registers call CFGCHIPn. Some of these registers function as clock
multiplexers. This document describes the bindings for those clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da850-async3-clock".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandle list of clocks corresponding to clock-names
- clock-names: must include the following: "pll0_sysclk2", "pll1_sysclk2".

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names: from common clock binding.

Parent:
This node must be a child of a "ti,da830-cfgchip" node.

Assignment:
The assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-parents from the common clock bindings
can be used to indicate which parent clock should be used.

Examples:

        cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
                compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
                reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

                async3_clk: async3 {
                        compatible = "ti,da850-async3-clock";
                        #clock-cells = <0>;
                        clocks = <&pll0_sysclk 2>, <&pll1_sysclk 2>;
                        clock-names = "pll0_sysclk2", "pll1_sysclk2";
                        assigned-clocks = <&async3_clk>;
                        assigned-clock-parents = <&pll1_sysclk 2>;
                        clock-output-names = "async3";
                };
        };
