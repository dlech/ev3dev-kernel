Binding for TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP USB PHY clocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a general purpose set of
registers call CFGCHIPn. Some of these registers function as the USB PHY
clocks. This document describes the bindings for those clocks.

The USB PHY clock node provides two clocks. The clock at index 0 is the USB 2.0
PHY clock and the clock at index 1 is the USB 1.1 PHY clock.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da830-usb-phy-clocks"
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.
- clocks: Shall be a phandle to the USB 2.0 PSC clock

Parent:
	This node must be a child of a "ti,da830-cfgchip" node. 

Assignment:
	The assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-parents properties from the
	common clock bindings can be used to indicate which parent clock is
	being used. The parent of the USB 2.0 PHY clock (index 0) can be
	either an external 48MHz clock named "usb_refclkin" or the AUXCLK
	("pll0_auxclk"). The parent of the USB 1.1 PHY clock (index 1) can
	be the same external 48MHz clock or it can be the USB 2.0 PHY clock.

Examples:

	/* using internal SoC clocks */
	cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
		compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

		usb_phy_clk: usb-phy-clocks {
			compatible = "ti,da830-usb-phy-clocks";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&psc1 1>;
			assigned-clocks = <&usb_phy_clk 0>, <&usb_phy_clk 1>;
			assigned-clock-parents = <&pll0_auxclk>, <&usb_phy_clk 0>;
		};
	};

	/* using external reference clock */
	usb_refclkin: usb_refclkin {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <48000000>;
		clock-output-names = "usb_refclkin";
	};
	...
	cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
		compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

		usb_phy_clk: usb-phy-clocks {
			compatible = "ti,da830-usb-phy-clocks";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&psc1 1>;
			assigned-clocks = <&usb_phy_clk 0>, <&usb_phy_clk 1>;
			assigned-clock-parents = <&usb_refclkin>, <&usb_refclkin>;
		};
	};
