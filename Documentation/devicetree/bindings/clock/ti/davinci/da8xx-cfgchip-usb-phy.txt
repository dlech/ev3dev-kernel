Binding for TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP USB PHY clocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a general purpose set of
registers call CFGCHIPn. Some of these registers function as the USB PHY
clocks. This document describes the bindings for those clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	- "ti,da830-usb0-phy-clock" for the USB 2.0 PHY
	- "ti,da830-usb1-phy-clock" for the USB 1.1 PHY
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandle list of clocks corresponding to clock-names
- clock-names: depends on compatible:
	- for "ti,da830-usb0-phy-clock" must be "usb_refclkin", "auxclk",
		"usb0_lpsc"
	- for "ti,da830-usb1-phy-clock" must be "usb0_phy", "usb_refclkin"

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names: from common clock binding.

Parent:
	This node must be a child of a "ti,da830-cfgchip" node. 

Assignment:
	The assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-parents properties from the
	common clock bindings can be used to indicate which parent clock should
	be used. Note: for "ti,da830-usb0-phy-clock", only "usb_refclkin" or
	"auxclk" can be used as the assigned parent clock ("usb0_lpsc" is not
	an actual parent clock and only used internally).

Examples:

	cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
		compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

		usb0_phy_clk: usb0-phy-clock {
			compatible = "ti,da830-usb0-phy-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&usb_refclkin>, <&pll0_aux_clk>, <&psc1 1>;
			clock-names = "usb_refclkin", "auxclk", "usb0_lpsc";
			clock-output-names = "usb0_phy_clk";
		};

		usb1_phy_clk: usb1-phy-clock {
			compatible = "ti,da830-usb1-phy-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&usb0_phy_clk>, <&usb_refclkin>;
			clock-names = "usb0_phy", "usb_refclkin";
			clock-output-names = "usb1_phy_clk";
		};
	};
