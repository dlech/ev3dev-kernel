Binding for TI DaVinci PLL Controllers

The PLL provides clocks to most of the components on the SoC. In addition
to the PLL itself, this controller also contains bypasses, gates, dividers,
an multiplexers for various clock signals.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	- "ti,da850-pll0" for PLL0 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
	- "ti,da850-pll1" for PLL1 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
- reg: physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
- clocks: phandle to the PLL input clock source

Optional child nodes:

sysclk
	Describes the PLLDIVn divider clocks that provide the SYSCLKn clock
	domains. The node name must be "sysclk". Consumers of this node should
	use "n" in "SYSCLKn" as the parameter for the clock cell.

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: must be 1

auxclk
	Describes the AUXCLK output of the PLL. The node name must be "auxclk".

	Required properties:
	- #clock-cells: must be 0

Examples:

	pll0: clock-controller@11000 {
		compatible = "ti,da850-pll0";
		reg = <0x11000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&ref_clk>;

		pll0_sysclk: sysclk {
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};

		pll0_aux_clk: auxclk {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
