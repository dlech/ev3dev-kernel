Binding for TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP gate clocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a general purpose set of
registers call CFGCHIPn. Some of these registers function as clock
gates. This document describes the bindings for those clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da830-tbclksync".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandle to the parent clock

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names: from common clock binding.

Parent:
This node must be a child of a "ti,da830-cfgchip" node. 

Assignment:
The assigned-clocks and assigned-clock-parents from the common clock bindings
can be used to indicate which parent clock should be used.

Examples:

	cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
		compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

		ehrpwm_tbclk: tbclk {
			compatible = "ti,da830-tbclksync";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&psc1 17>;
			clock-output-names = "ehrpwm_tbclk";
		};
	};
