Status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

Binding for keystone PLLs. The main PLL IP typically has a multiplier,
a divider and a post divider. The additional PLL IPs like ARMPLL, DDRPLL
and PAPLL are controlled by the memory mapped register where as the Main
PLL is controlled by a PLL controller registers along with memory mapped
registers.

Binding is also used for davinci PLLs.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

Required properties:
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- compatible : shall be "ti,keystone,main-pll-clock", "ti,keystone,pll-clock"
		or "ti,davinci,pll-clock"
- clocks : parent clock phandle
- reg - pll registers
- reg-names : control, multiplier, pre-divider and post-divider.
		"ti,keystone,main-pll-clock" requires control, multiplier and
		post-divider. "ti,keystone,pll-clock" requires only control.
		"ti,davinci,pll-clock" requires multiplier and post-divider and
		optionally uses pre-divider. In all cases, post-divider is
		omitted when using fixed-postdiv.
- fixed-postdiv : fixed post divider value. If absent, use clkod register bits
		for postdiv

Example:
	mainpllclk: mainpllclk@2310110 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,keystone,main-pll-clock";
		clocks = <&refclksys>;
		reg = <0x02620350 4>, <0x02310110 4>, <0x02310108 4>;
		reg-names = "control", "multiplier", "post-divider";
	};

	papllclk: papllclk@2620358 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,keystone,pll-clock";
		clocks = <&refclkpass>;
		clock-output-names = "pa-pll-clk";
		reg = <0x02620358 4>;
		reg-names = "control";
		fixed-postdiv = <2>;
	};

	pll0: pll@1c10000 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,davinci,pll-clock";
		clocks = <&oscin>;
		clock-output-names = "pll0";
		reg = <0x11114 4>, <0x11110 4>, <0x11128 4>;
		reg-names = "pre-divider", "multiplier", "post-divider";
	};


Required properties:
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- compatible : shall be "ti,keystone,pll-mux-clock"
- clocks : link phandles of parent clocks
- reg - pll mux register
- bit-shift : number of bits to shift the bit-mask
- bit-mask : arbitrary bitmask for programming the mux

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

Example:
	mainmuxclk: mainmuxclk@2310108 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,keystone,pll-mux-clock";
		clocks = <&mainpllclk>, <&refclkmain>;
		reg = <0x02310108 4>;
		bit-shift = <23>;
		bit-mask = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "mainmuxclk";
	};

Required properties:
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- compatible : shall be "ti,keystone,pll-divider-clock"
- clocks : parent clock phandle
- reg - pll mux register
- bit-shift : number of bits to shift the bit-mask
- bit-mask : arbitrary bitmask for programming the divider

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

Example:
	gemtraceclk: gemtraceclk@2310120 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,keystone,pll-divider-clock";
		clocks = <&mainmuxclk>;
		reg = <0x02310120 4>;
		bit-shift = <0>;
		bit-mask = <8>;
