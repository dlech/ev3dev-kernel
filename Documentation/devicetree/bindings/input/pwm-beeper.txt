* PWM beeper device tree bindings

Registers a PWM device as beeper.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "pwm-beeper"
- pwms: phandle to the physical PWM device

Optional properties:
- enable-gpios: phandle to gpio to enable the beeper

Example:

beeper {
	compatible = "pwm-beeper";
	pwms = <&pwm0>;
	enable-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};
